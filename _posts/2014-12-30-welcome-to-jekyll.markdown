You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

GitHub Flavored Markdown is supported.

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

And $$\mathcal{ Mathematics }$$ is supported!

Use `$$` to wrap your formulas. For example, `$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$` displays $$  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0  $$

Multi-line forumlas are supported too. asfrtgvfarfe

$$
\begin{aligned}
& J(w, b) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}L(\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})
+ \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{l=1}^{L}{||w||}^2_F\\\\
& {||w||}^2_F = \sum_{i = 1}^{n[l]}\sum_{j = 1}^{n[l-1]}(w_{ij})^2
\end{aligned}
